# WRONG-SITTING-POSTURE-DETECTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING.
# ABSTRACT
Using an image classification algorithm, the system aims to identify the user's sitting posture and provide suggestions on how to better maintain it. The project will provide a new posture-detecting technology. The COVID epidemic has led to a significant rise in the number of people working from home, frequently without the requisite ergonomic gear and infrastructure. Incorrect desk heights, inadequate desktop chairs, and excessive laptop usage all offer serious health risks to users. To make matters worse, poor sitting posture may contribute to a variety of health problems, including but not limited to: back pain, headaches from pinched nerves, and spinal dysfunction. Lower back discomfort is on the rise, yet the number of sufferers has never been observed to decrease. In addition, around 20% of the population is affected by this kind of illness, with the majority of those affected being software developers. Responsible citizens may utilize the information gained here to develop their own plans for addressing the country's back pain crisis. 
Solution: The suggested project uses technology based on webcams to identify and detect a person's sitting position in real time. Based on the results, the person is then given a result as to whether the sitting posture is correct or wrong. The application uses computer vision and convolutional neural networks to analyse human postures and immediately notifies the users to recheck their postures through the web app. The data provided as input to the network is divided into two sub-classes, and each posture is then recognized and analysed. For primary training and testing purposes, convolutional neural networks were used as they provide an intuitive way of looking at images, analysing adjacent pixels in small areas and inputting those readings into a pooling layer.
The performance of the application will be evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics. The results of the evaluation will be used to improve the accuracy of the model.
In conclusion, this study will develop a web application that can detect wrong sitting postures using CNNs. The application will be able to detect wrong postures in real-time and provide feedback to help users correct their postures. The results of the evaluation will be used to improve the accuracy of the model.
